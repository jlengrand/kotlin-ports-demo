# Kotlin Ports Demo

This repository is a demo of how the [Elm ports] method can be used to quickly introduce a Javascript library into a Kotlin/JS project without too much work with external declarations.

It is a support to **[this blog post](https://lengrand.fr/using-elm-knowledge-to-dive-into-kotlin-js)**

This repository contains a short [Kotlin/Js](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-interop.html) project with a [Firebase integration](https://firebase.google.com/).
